# Bunny Extinction

**Limits online play.**

*Your faults will not be forgiven*

## Features
- Permadeath. Dying once in a run means you can no longer participate in future encounters

### Infernal BBQ
- Bullet Deletion Disabled
- Invulnerability Disabled
- 1 Health Max
- -2 Speed Max
- Red Tanzaku no longer forgives you
- Shira "Steel Yourself" attacks are invulnable (must be placed above Steelheart)

## Steelheart Compatibility
Steelheart forces you to tank 2 Shira "Steel Yourself" attacks and disables the third one.
In Bunny Extinction, because maximum health is 1, these attacks can be invulned again.
Ensure that BunnyExtinction is placed above Steelheart within your mod arrangement (or below idk remind me to check).
